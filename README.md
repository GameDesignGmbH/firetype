firetype
=================

Goals
-----

firetype is an Open Source Actionscript 3 library that parses OpenType fonts, converts the contained vector glyphs into polygon shapes and renders them using Stage3D via the GPU.

One of the examples for a similar technology would be [Scaleform](http://gameware.autodesk.com/scaleform) which is used in many big-budget productions to render hardware accelerated text and UI elements.

firetype aims to make similar functionality available for Actionscript 3 developers using Stage3D.
